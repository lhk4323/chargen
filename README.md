Random character generator assignment
This particular assignment stood out for me because this is where I truly learned CSS from scratch on my own. All my assignments previous to this used very minimal CSS, such as changing the background color.  I really did not take the time to learn CSS, I just learned enough to pass the assignment.

With this assignment, CSS was important (and the class prequesite was to know CSS, which I skipped entirely. I also have no qualms with starting a video game on HARD my first time playing), but we also had an extra week to do the assignment. I decided to take the time and learn CSS on my own and built the border, positioned the background, and fix the font.

In hindsight, I spent way too much time on the CSS. I remember spending more than 3 hours on it and when I look at it now, I think why did I spend so much time on it and how I could improve it. But at the time, I was very proud.

The JS involved on this project was not complex as it required a lot of object property assignments and random number generators. And a lot of document.write text.  Originally the assignment didn't have the buttons on the page (not required) but I wanted to add a background generator (conceptually it was going to be a LOT more complex but I realized it was going to be overkill). To prevent a user from changing their minds, I locked the buttons after a background selection was made (although I made it unlockable after all were selected via a reset button).  

If I were to re-do this assignment, I would include an option for the user to input their name or have it randomly selected. Same for class, race, and maybe age. Stat rolls and skills would all be randomized still.  I would also redo the background generator to be more complex and have more options. At the time I wrote this assignment, I couldn't figure out how to have the code "store" the user's selection and output it later.  What I wanted to do is let the user choose a bunch of different selections and then, at the end, the program would create a background based on the user's inputs. 

The more I think about it, the right call would be to store the user's selections and assign a variable to the selection, and then at the end of the selections, just concatenate the variables with background text.
